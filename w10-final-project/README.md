## Description of final project 

This project is my *final project for Harvard’s CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science* where we had to create something using what we had learned in the course. As the course description states:  

📌 *“The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. You may implement your project in any language(s). You are welcome to utilize infrastructure other than the CS50 Codespace. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.”*  


## 🌟 About the Project  
I decided to combine two of my passions— *Gran Canaria and programming* —to build a web page where users can explore attractions on the island. Users can filter attractions by category, such as beaches, hiking, or cultural spots, and view detailed information about each place.  

Building this site has been a journey of combining *HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL* . It wasn’t just about showcasing Gran Canaria—it pushed me to apply new skills while working on something meaningful to me.  


## ✨ Features  
✅ *Search & Filter* – Users can search for attractions by category (beach, hiking, food, etc.).  
✅ *Add New Attractions* – A hidden page allows adding attractions to the database for those with the link.  
✅ *Map Integration* – A map displays attractions based on coordinates, helping users find nearby places to explore together.  


## 📂 Project Files  
📌 *index.html* – The main page with a map and attraction list, featuring category filters.  
📌 *base.html* – A base template with reusable elements like navigation and footer.  
📌 *detail.html* – Individual attraction pages with detailed descriptions and images.  
📌 *add.html* – A hidden page for adding new attractions without using SQL directly.  
📌 *script.js* – Handles user interactions, data fetching, and rendering.  
📌 *styles.css* – Styles the website for a clean and responsive design.  
📌 *attractions.db* – A SQL database storing attraction data like title, description, category, photos, and coordinates.  


## 🚀 Design Choices & Challenges  
I built this project with *JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL* to ensure a simple and scalable web app. I was most comfortable with *JavaScript, HTML, and CSS* but had to learn more about *Python and SQL* to implement the features I wanted.  

### 🔥 Challenges Faced:  
🔹 *Database Integration* – Learning how to connect SQL with the frontend using Jinja templates was a steep but rewarding learning curve.  
🔹 *Map Feature* – Initially used *Leaflet* but later switched to *Google Maps* for a better design and experience.  
🔹 *JSON Parsing Errors* – Fixing errors in my script initially broke the map, but after research, I found a solution by splitting the code into multiple script tags.  

Despite the challenges, I *loved working on this project* . There were moments I wished I had a mentor to guide me, but thanks to *online communities* I figured things out.  

🚀 This project might not be impressive to everyone, but for me, building something like this in a few months is an *incredible achievement*. 

🎯 I’m *proud of myself* and eager to learn more—so much so that I’ve already signed up for *CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript* to continue learning!
